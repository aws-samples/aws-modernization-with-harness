      <description>Create a Workspace AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that Let’s you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don’t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.
We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS account via the AWS CLI in this Workshop.</description>

      <description>Configure workspace for Harness Workshop Cloud9 normally manages IAM credentials dynamically. This isn&amp;rsquo;t currently compatible with the EKS IAM authentication, so we will disable it and rely on the IAM role instead.
  Return to your workspace and click the gear icon (in top right corner), or click to open a new tab and choose &amp;ldquo;Open Preferences&amp;rdquo;
 Select AWS SETTINGS and turn off AWS managed temporary credentials</description>
