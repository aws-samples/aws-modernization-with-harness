      <description>How did we get here? It is 2am on a Saturday morning, your dinner is cold because you have been on a bridge call with the Operations and Engineering teams (now jointly called DevOps) since 7pm trying to roll back the changes applied in the latest update. There are a number of items that need to be rolled back to get to the previously working state but because there is no clear understanding of all the changes that occurred, no one is comfortable rolling back and now you are waiting on a new build to roll forward.</description>

      <description>Deploy without worry Deployments with Kubernetes? Kubernetes (k8s) is a container orchestration platform allowing organizations to scale their services and workloads quickly. If you are working with containers or microservices, k8s may be a great use case for you. Kubenetes deployments are container image deployments which target k8s-based environments.
Amazon has released a managed k8s service called Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Amazon EKS helps you provide highly-available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.</description>

      <description>What is Harness? Harness is the industryâ€™s first Continuous Delivery-as-a-Service platform that enables software changes of all types to reach production environments in a safe, quick and sustainable way. Harness helps accelerate cloud adoption and cloud migration activities while also enabling advanced deployment patterns and developer self-service. Harness simplifies the software delivery process, abstracting away the complexities of new technologies, making it easy for customers to automate the CI/CD process.</description>
