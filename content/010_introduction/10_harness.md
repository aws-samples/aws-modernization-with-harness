Harness is the industryâ€™s first Continuous Delivery-as-a-Service platform that enables software changes of all types to reach production environments in a safe, quick and sustainable way. Harness helps accelerate cloud adoption and cloud migration activities while also enabling advanced deployment patterns and developer self-service. Harness simplifies the software delivery process, abstracting away the complexities of new technologies, making it easy for customers to automate the CI/CD process. Machine learning is leveraged to automatically verify every deployment and initiates rollbacks if needed.
